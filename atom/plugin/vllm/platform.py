       (only the CSA/HCA compressed pages are). Rather than disable caching, we
       install a KVCacheManager patch that rolls every prefix hit back by
       ``max(win_with_spec, index_topk)`` tokens so the tail is re-forwarded and
       the ring is repopulated (mirrors native ATOM "fix B'").
       See ``deepseek_v4_prefix_patch``.

    2. Guard the non-chunked oversized forward: with chunked prefill off, vLLM
       couples max_num_batched_tokens to max_model_len, so a native max_model_len
       forces a single ~max_model_len-token forward that overflows int32 element
       offsets in per-token kernels. Fail fast with an actionable error instead
       of crashing with "illegal memory access". Enable chunked prefill for long
       context.
